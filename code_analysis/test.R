# Write a script to take the prime numbers and square them

# Create a vector of prime numbers
prime <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)

# Square the prime numbers
prime_sq <- prime^2

#Now plot the prime numbers
plot(prime_sq, prime, pch = 19, col = "red", cex = 2, xlab = "Prime Squared", ylab = "Prime")
